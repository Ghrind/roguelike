# Roguelike

Another roguelike attempt where I will test the common roguelike algorithms (pathfinding, field of view, IA, ...)

## Game features ideas

* Difficulty should not automatically scale to player's level
* Player has a level and gains experience
* When reaching a given amount of experience, player gains a level
* Upon advancing in the game, stats should grow
* Player gains experience by killing monsters or other feats
* Player can equip item to boost his stats or gain new abilities

* Game of numbers or game of feelings?
* Game that scales (casual) or challenging game (unique difficulty, the player must adapt, grind, ...)?
* What is the game atmosphere (funny, violent, ...)?
* What does a typical game looks like?
* What are the player/ennemies abilities?
* What kind of characters can be played?
* What is the goal of the game, why would a person play it?

* Killing blows (brutal!)
* Ennemy flees when hit too hard
* No HP, but a system of wounds
* Random ennemies: even the creator of the game is surprised
